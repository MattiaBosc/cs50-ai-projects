## Description
This project implements a **reinforcement learning AI** to play the game of Nim.  
The AI uses **Q-learning** to learn optimal moves by playing against itself repeatedly.

## Objective
Build an AI that can:
- Learn the rules and strategy of Nim.
- Improve its performance over time through self-play.
- Choose actions based on **epsilon-greedy** strategy during training and **greedy** strategy during actual gameplay.
