# CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

## Description
This repository contains my personal implementations of the projects from **Harvard’s CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**. Each project demonstrates key concepts in artificial intelligence, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, reinforcement learning, machine learning, and neural networks.

## Projects

- **Attention**  
  Uses a BERT masked language model to predict missing words in a sentence and visualizes attention patterns across transformer layers.

- **Crossword**  
  Implements a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver to generate crossword puzzles satisfying all grid constraints.

- **Degrees**  
  Implements a shortest-path search algorithm to determine degrees of separation between actors.

- **Heredity**  
  Uses a Bayesian Network to calculate the probability of genetic traits in a family.

- **Knights**  
  Solves Knights and Knaves logic puzzles using propositional logic and model checking.

- **Minesweeper**  
  Implements an AI capable of playing Minesweeper using knowledge-based reasoning and logical inference.

- **Nim**  
  Implements a reinforcement learning AI that plays the game of Nim using Q-learning and self-play.

- **PageRank**  
  Implements the PageRank algorithm to rank web pages by importance using random sampling and iterative calculation.

- **Shopping**  
  Implements a k-nearest neighbors classifier to predict whether online shopping users will complete a purchase.

- **Sentence Parsing**  
  Parses English sentences and extracts noun phrase chunks using a context-free grammar and NLP techniques.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**  
  AI plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using the Minimax algorithm.

- **Traffic**  
  Uses TensorFlow to train a neural network that classifies images of traffic signs from the GTSRB dataset.
