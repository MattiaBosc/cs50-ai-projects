# Heredity

## Description
This project implements a **Bayesian Network** to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait.  
It calculates the probability distribution for each personâ€™s **gene copies** (0, 1, or 2) and whether they exhibit a **trait** based on inheritance and mutation probabilities.

## Objective
Build a program that can:
- Compute the **joint probability** of a genetic configuration for a family.
- Update probability distributions based on new evidence.
- Normalize probabilities so they sum to 1.
- Infer the likelihood of each person having a trait or a certain number of gene copies.
