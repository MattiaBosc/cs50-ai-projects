# Minesweeper

## Description
This project implements an **AI agent** capable of playing **Minesweeper** using **knowledge-based reasoning**.  
The AI deduces which cells are safe and which contain mines by representing information about the board as **logical sentences** and performing **inferences** on its knowledge base.

## Objective
Build an AI that can:
- Safely identify mines and safe cells.
- Make logical moves based on information from revealed cells.
- Optionally, make random moves when no safe move is guaranteed.

The goal is to mimic human reasoning and improve efficiency in solving Minesweeper puzzles.
