## Description
This project implements an **AI that parses English sentences** and extracts **noun phrase chunks** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.  
The AI uses a **context-free grammar (CFG)** formalism via the NLTK library to determine the syntactic structure of a sentence.

## Objective
- Parse English sentences to generate a **syntax tree**.  
- Identify **noun phrases (NP)** in the sentence.  
- Handle complex noun phrases like "the red armchair" or "my companion".
