# Knights

## Description
This project implements an AI to solve **Knights and Knaves logic puzzles**, inspired by Raymond Smullyan’s classic book *“What is the Name of This Book?” (1978)*.  
Each character in these puzzles is either a **knight**, who always tells the truth, or a **knave**, who always lies. The AI determines each character’s identity based on their statements using **propositional logic** and **model checking**.

## Objective
Given a set of characters and their statements, the program automatically deduces for each character whether they are a knight or a knave.  
The goal is to represent the puzzles as logical sentences and solve them programmatically.
