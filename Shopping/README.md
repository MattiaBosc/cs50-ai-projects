# Shopping

## Description
This project implements a **machine learning classifier** to predict whether online shopping users will complete a purchase.  
The AI uses **k-nearest neighbors (k = 1)** to make predictions based on user session data.

## Objective
Build a program that can:
- Load and preprocess data from `shopping.csv`.
- Train a nearest-neighbor classifier to predict purchase intent.
- Evaluate model performance using **sensitivity** (true positive rate) and **specificity** (true negative rate).
