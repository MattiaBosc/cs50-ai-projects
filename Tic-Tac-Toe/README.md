# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This project implements an AI to play **Tic-Tac-Toe optimally** using the **Minimax algorithm**. The program determines the best possible move at each stage of the game, ensuring that the AI cannot be beaten if it plays optimally.  

## Objective
The goal is to apply the **Minimax decision rule** to the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, enabling the AI to evaluate possible future game states and always choose the optimal move.
