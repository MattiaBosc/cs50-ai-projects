# Traffic Sign Recognition

## Description
This project implements an **AI for recognizing traffic signs** using computer vision and deep learning.  
The AI uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow to classify images of traffic signs into one of 43 categories.

## Objective
Build a neural network that can:
- Identify the type of traffic sign in a given photograph.
- Achieve high accuracy on a labeled dataset.
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional layers for image recognition.

## Dataset
- **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**  
- Contains 43 categories of traffic signs (0 through 42).  
- Each category folder contains multiple images of that traffic sign.  
- Images vary in size and are resized to `(IMG_WIDTH, IMG_HEIGHT)` for input into the network.
